## 📝 Code Style & Guidelines

- **Language**: We use TypeScript in strict mode. Try to avoid `any` where possible.
- **Formatting**: Keep the code clean. We use standard JSX conventions for components.
- **Dependencies**: Since this is meant to be a lightweight tool, please discuss before adding heavy npm packages to the project.
